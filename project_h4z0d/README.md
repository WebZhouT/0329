# Apex Bot
## Description of the function of the application
Apex bot is an application that is designed for the Apex Legends
players to help them **become better at decision-making in their future gameplay experience**.

By recording the data of a game (from the *Legends*, *Shield Level*, *Damage made*,
*Weapons*, *Total Kills*, *Squad Legends*, *Squad Damage*), graph will be made for the users to see which legends and 
weapons they are better at, what kind of decision they would better make in different 
situations. It would also become a good reference for players to learn 
team work better from the data collected. 

The application is a great interest to me as I enjoyed playing this game
with my friends together. If a more personalized advice can be given to me, 
I believe I can perform better and become more effective to work as a team in 
the game.
